<h3>magnetic separator conveyor indonesia</h3><img src='1708663341.jpg' alt=''><p>Magnetic separator machine is used to remove iron in the coal, non-metallic processing, and ceramics industries. Magnetic separator is widely used in the mining industry to separate tramp ore’s, mixed with the magnetic material, into magnetic and non-magnetic materials.</p><p>In addition, coal magnetic separator is used to de-iron for coal, non-metal ore and building materials. So we can say that magnetic separator is one of the most widely used machines.</p><p>Two types of magnetic separators are dry magnetic separator and wet magnetic separator. And the wet magnetic separator is more commonly used. So the wet magnetic separator is more popular in Indonesia.</p><p>The dry magnetic separator is suitable for the separation of magnetite, pyrrhotite, roasted ore, ilmenite and other materials with a particle size of less than 3mm. It is also used for iron removal of coal, non-metallic minerals, building materials, etc. It is used in the ceramics industry to remove iron and improve the quality of raw materials. It is also used in the chemical industry to purify materials.</p><p>Meanwhile, the wet magnetic separator is most suitable for the separation of magnetite, pyrrhotite, calcined ore, ilmenite and other materials with a particle size of below 3mm. In addition, it is used for iron removal operations of coal, non-metallic minerals, building materials, and other materials. It can improve the quality of raw materials and is commonly used in the ceramic and chemical industries.</p><p>The magnetic separator conveyor belt products, including rubber conveyor belt and stainless steel conveyor belts, are supplied by us to various industries who are using machines like magnetic separator machinery, vibrating screen machinery etc.</p><p>Magnetic separator conveyor belt is fabricated using finest quality raw material, complying with international standards.
