It is a rock formed from the cooling of magma deep within the earth's crust. Granite is a very hard and durable stone, making it a preferred choice for construction purposes. It is commonly used as a building material for houses, bridges, and roads. The strength and aesthetic appeal of granite make it a popular choice for countertops, flooring, and wall cladding as well.</p><p>Limestone is another popular crushed stone found in Nigeria. It is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate. Limestone is used in many construction projects due to its versatility. It can be crushed into various sizes and used as a base material for roads, driveways, and parking lots. It is also frequently used as an aggregate in concrete production. Limestone can be found in many parts of Nigeria, particularly in the southwestern region.</p><p>Marble is a beautiful and luxurious crushed stone found in Nigeria. It is formed from limestone that undergoes a metamorphic process. Marble has been used for centuries as a decorative stone in buildings, sculptures, and monuments. Its unique veining and color variations make it highly sought after for its aesthetic appeal. In Nigeria, marble is mostly found in the northern parts of the country, such as Kogi, Niger, and Kwara states.</p><p>Crushed stones such as gravel and quartzite are also abundant in Nigeria. Gravel is a loose aggregation of small, round stones or pebbles. It is commonly used in the construction industry for making concrete, road base, and drainage systems.

It is very hard and durable, making it suitable for use in high-traffic areas and outdoor spaces.</p><p>In conclusion, Nigeria is blessed with a variety of crushed stones that have various applications in construction and decorative projects.
