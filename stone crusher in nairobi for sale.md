The stone that is too large to pass through the top deck of the scalping screen is processed in the secondary crusher. Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary crushing, which typically reduces material to about 2.5 to 10 centimeters.</p><p>Stone crushing is generally processed in three stages: primary crushing, secondary crushing, and tertiary crushing. Primary crushing is usually done using jaw crushers, and the output size is controlled by the addition of a screen at the end.
