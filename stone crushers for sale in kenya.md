When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger, thereby pushing the movable jaw plate closer to the fixed jaw plate, and the material passes through the two jaws. This process is repeated until the material is crushed to the required particle size and discharged through the discharge port.</p><p>Stone crushers are widely used in construction sites, mine sites, and stone quarries. It crushes large stones into smaller pieces to be used in subsequent construction activities.
